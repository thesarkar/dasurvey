# Data Analyst Survey Report

In this project, I have utilized data from a survey conducted among Data Analysts on LinkedIn to create an insightful and interactive report using Power BI. The goal of this project is to analyze various professional aspects of the professional lives of individuals working in data-related fields. The report addresses the following key questions:

**1)** What is average salary per profession in a data related field?

**2)** Are they happy with their work-life balance?

**3)** What is their favorite language to work on?

**4)** How difficult is it to become a data analyst?

**5)** Are they happy with their salary?

The findings are based on real survey data from LinkedIn, with a total of 630 participants. The Power BI report is easy to navigate and can be easily be understood by technical and non-technical stakeholders. 

This Power BI report serves as a valuable resource for understanding the current state of the data analysis profession. Whether you are an employer looking to improve workplace conditions, an educator aiming to tailor your curriculum, or an aspiring data analyst seeking insights into the field, this report offers actionable information derived from the lived experiences of data professionals.
